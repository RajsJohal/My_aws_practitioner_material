# Provision AWS Resources

## Methods of interacting with AWS Services
#### AWS Mangement Console
- A web based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. 
- You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks. 
- There is also the AWS console mobile application to perform tasks such as monitoring resources, viewing alarms and access billing information. Multiple identities can stay logged into the AWS Console obile app at the same time. 

#### AWS Command Line Interface
- Enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS and Linux. 
- You can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts. 

#### Software Development Kits
- Make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- You provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
    - Adjust capacity
    - Load balancing
    - Automatic scaling
    - Application health monitoring

## AWS CloudFormation
- Infrastructure as code AWS resource
- Build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS management console to individually provision resources.
