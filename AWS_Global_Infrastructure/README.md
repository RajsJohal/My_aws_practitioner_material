# AWS Global Infrastructure
#### Selecting a Region
- There are several factors to consider when selecting a region:
    - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
    - Proximity to your customers
    - Available services within a region
    - Pricing

#### Availability Zones
- A single data centre or a group of data centres within a region. They are located tens of miles from eachother. Close enough to have minimum latency between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected. 

## Edge Locations
- A site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery. 

## AWS Outposts
- A family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience.
